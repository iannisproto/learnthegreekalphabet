                The Greek letter psi appears as Ψ in uppercase and ψ in
                lowercase. Scholars trace its origins to the Phoenician script.
                In that context, the letter originates from the word "tsade."
                This term is often linked to the idea of a hook or a tool,
                suggesting a practical everyday object. It originally
                represented a sound that combined "p" and "s," a pairing not
                found in many other letters.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Greek writing developed, psi retained its dual sound while
                its form underwent subtle changes. Early inscriptions show a
                design that is more angular, and later texts offer a cleaner,
                standardised shape. Writers and scribes occasionally embellished
                the character. Nobody knows if they intended to be playful or
                simply followed evolving aesthetic trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern times, psi finds itself in many academic arenas. In
                physics, it is widely used to denote wave functions in quantum
                mechanics, a subject that challenges even the brightest minds.
                In mathematics, psi helps label functions and variables, making
                complex formulas easier to follow. Psychology has also embraced
                the letter, sometimes using it as a symbol for the field itself.
                Even computer programming discussions occasionally feature psi
                when addressing character sets. In neuroscience and
                parapsychology, psi sometimes represents psychic phenomena.
