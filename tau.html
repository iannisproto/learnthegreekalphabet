                Tau is a letter with deep roots in ancient alphabets. Its story
                begins in the Phoenician era, where its precursor was known as
                “taw.” This word meant a mark or a sign, serving as a basic tool
                for communication in early civilisations. The Phoenicians carved
                tau in stone and clay, giving it a simple yet enduring design
                that influenced many future scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Greeks later adopted tau, modifying its shape to suit the
                phonetic needs of their language. In Greek, tau came to
                represent the [t] sound. Unlike some letters that attracted much
                attention, tau maintained a modest profile. Its straightforward
                appearance and practical role helped it become a reliable part
                of the Greek writing system.
            </p>
            <p>
                As cultures mingled, tau passed on to the Etruscans and then to
                the Romans. The Roman version of tau is very similar to the
                Greek form, though minor stylistic changes mark its evolution.
                These changes did not alter the essential role of the letter; it
                remained a tool for everyday writing and communication. Nobody
                can dispute tau’s practical value even though it rarely grabs
                the spotlight like some of its alphabetical companions.
