                The letter pi has deep roots in ancient writing systems. It
                began when Greek scholars adopted characters from the Phoenician
                script. Its ancestor is the Phoenician letter pe, a mark that
                meant “mouth” and stood for the sound /p/. Early users pressed a
                simple sign into clay and stone to record everyday words. Nobody
                knows exactly how these symbols sparked interest, but evidence
                shows they served traders and scribes with clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, Greek writers refined the form of pi. Early versions
                differ noticeably from the shape recognised today. Scribes
                adjusted the design to suit their writing style. Gradual changes
                produced a cleaner and more standardised symbol. Historians note
                that these adaptations were influenced by practical needs and
                available materials. At one stage, the letter looked so
                different that it might have passed for a variation of another
                character.
            </p>

                Modern uses of pi extend across various fields. Mathematics
                employs pi as the symbol for the constant that represents the
                ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. Scientists
                and engineers work with this symbol in formulas that describe
                physical phenomena. Computer programmers even include it in
                coding contexts when precise mathematical expressions are
                needed. In classrooms and on calendars, pi also appears as a
                cultural reference during Pi Day celebrations.
