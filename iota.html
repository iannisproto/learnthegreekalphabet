                The letter Iota is one of the simplest characters in the Greek
                alphabet. It is the ninth letter and began as a development of
                the Phoenician letter Yodh. The Phoenician term for Yodh meant
                "hand." Early Greek writers adopted this character to represent
                a basic vowel sound. Its form came directly from Yodh and was
                initially similar to a simple mark used in writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In early inscriptions, Iota kept a form that was easy to write
                and read. As the Greek language developed, the shape of Iota
                became more streamlined and abstract while still keeping a clear
                connection to its origins. Greek scribes used Iota not only in
                everyday writing but also in more formal texts. In addition,
                Iota became part of the Greek numeral system, where it held a
                specific value. This numerical use helped scholars and traders
                work with numbers in a straightforward way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Iota continues to be used in the modern Greek language.
                It appears in textbooks, signs, and other everyday writings. In
                academic subjects such as mathematics and science, Iota is
                sometimes used to denote a small quantity or to serve as a
                variable in equations. Outside of its use in the Greek language,
                many people have adopted the term "iota" in common speech to
                describe a very small amount of something.
