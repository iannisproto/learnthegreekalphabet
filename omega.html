            <p>
                Omega is the final letter in the Greek alphabet and has a rich
                history that starts with ancient Phoenician scripts. Its origin
                can be traced to the Phoenician letter "ʿayin", a word that
                means "eye." Early Greek speakers adopted this symbol to
                represent a long "o" sound, naming it Omega or "great O" to
                clearly distinguish it from Omicron, which stood for the short
                "o" sound. Nobody knew that a simple mark could spark such a
                practical naming scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Greeks altered the shape of this symbol as they moved from
                carving letters in stone to writing them by hand. The change was
                modest, addressing the need for fluidity in writing rather than
                a dramatic overhaul of its form. Omega kept its role as a marker
                for the long vowel sound while adapting to new writing tools and
                materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Omega is used in many fields outside of language. In
                mathematics, it frequently represents the final element in a
                sequence or an unbounded set. In physics, the symbol stands for
                electrical resistance or angular velocity. Computer science also
                borrows Omega when discussing limits or ultimate values in
                algorithm analysis.
