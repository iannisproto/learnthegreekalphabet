                The letter Zeta is the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet,
                represented by the capital "Ζ" and lowercase "ζ." Its origins
                can be traced back to the Phoenician letter "Zayin," which meant
                "weapon." The Greeks adopted Zeta around the 8th century BCE,
                modifying its shape and sound to fit their language.

                In ancient Greece, Zeta held cultural significance. It was not
                just a letter; it often represented strength and power. In
                various contexts, Zeta was associated with the idea of
                protection and defence, reflecting its origins as a symbol of a
                weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Zeta continues to be important in various fields. In
                mathematics, it is used to denote specific functions, such as
                the Riemann Zeta function, which plays a crucial role in number
                theory. This mathematical significance highlights Zeta's
                relevance in scientific discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond its mathematical applications, Zeta has also made its way
                into popular culture. It appears in various names,
                organisations, and brands, often suggesting strength or
                resilience. in North American university life, many fraternities
                and sororities use Greek letters, and Zeta is often chosen to
                signify a group that embodies strength and unity.
