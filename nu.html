                The letter Nu is the 13th character of the Greek alphabet. It
                comes from the Phoenician letter Nun, a symbol originally linked
                to a fish. Early Greek scribes adopted Nu with a simple design
                that met the needs of their writing. In the earliest examples,
                Nu was drawn as a basic mark, easy to carve on stone or inscribe
                on clay.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Greek writing developed, the form of Nu changed across
                regions. Local variations existed, but the need for clear
                communication led to a more uniform shape. Some texts show Nu
                with a slight curve, while others display it in a more angular
                form. Despite these differences, Nu consistently represented the
                /n/ sound. In some cases, Nu was also used in the Greek numeral
                system to denote a specific value, which helped traders and
                scholars work with numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Nu appears in modern Greek texts in everyday writing and
                formal documents. Its role extends into academic subjects as
                well. In physics, Nu is often used to denote frequency or
                appears in formulas related to waves. In statistics, Nu
                represents degrees of freedom in certain tests, while in
                mathematics it serves as a variable in various equations. These
                uses show that Nu has remained practical and adaptable over
                time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evolution of Nu is a clear example of how a simple symbol
                from an ancient alphabet can be refined for modern use. Its
                straightforward design and practical role in language and
                science have kept it relevant.
