                The letter Delta is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet,
                represented by the capital "Δ" and lowercase "δ." Its origins
                can be traced back to the Phoenician letter "Dalet," which meant
                "door." The Greeks adopted Delta around the 8th century BCE,
                modifying its shape and sound to fit their language.
            </p>
            <p>
                In ancient Greece, Delta held significant cultural and
                linguistic importance. It was not just a letter, it symbolised
                change and transition. In mathematics and science Delta is often
                used to represent change or difference, such as in the term
                "delta" for differences in values. This association with change
                has made Delta a powerful symbol in various fields, particularly
                in calculus and physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Delta continues to be relevant in many areas. In the
                Greek numeral system, it represents the number four, being its
                position in the alphabet. In the context of science, Delta is
                frequently used in equations as variations, such as in the
                change of temperature or pressure. This usage proves its value
                in scientific discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond its mathematical and scientific applications, Delta has
                also made its way into popular culture. It appears in various
                names, organisations, and brands, often suggesting
                transformation or progress. For example, Delta Airlines uses the
                letter in its name, symbolising movement and travel.
