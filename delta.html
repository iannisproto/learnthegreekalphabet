                Delta is the fourth of the Greek letters. It's existed for
                thousands of years and has inspired writing systems and symbols
                in a number of societies. The letter originates from the
                Phoenician letter "dalet," used to signify "door." It was
                adopted by the Greeks, who gave it its contemporary triangle
                shape. It eventually found itself incorporated into the Latin
                alphabet and affected the letter D.
            </p>
            <p>
                Delta has a great number of meanings. It is used to represent
                change in difference or value variations in mathematics and
                science. Delta is used quite often in equations that represent
                changes in increases and decreases in things like speed or
                temperature. It can be utilised to represent changes in the cost
                or demand of economics too. As a symbol for change, its use
                comes naturally because of the historical history it has built
                while moving from writing system to writing system.
            </p>
            <p>
                In ancient Greece, the delta letter was also associated with
                physical architecture. Triangular land masses occurring at river
                mouths were called a "delta". This term survives to the present
                day, one of the best-known examples being the Nile Delta. The
                overlap between the delta letter's form and natural shapes is
                one of those things which is almost too good to be true.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, delta came to represent structure and stability in
                some contexts, although it represented change in others. It
                appears in engineering, navigation, and even military
                terminology. Its geometric simplicity and triangular shape make
                it simple to recognise and replicate, which most likely explains
                its never-ending popularity.
