                The letter Mu is the 12th character of the Greek alphabet. It
                comes from the Phoenician letter Mem, a term originally linked
                to the idea of water. Early Greek writers adopted Mu with a
                simple design that suited the practical needs of their writing.
                In its first forms, Mu was drawn with clear, straight lines that
                made it easy to reproduce on stone and clay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Greek scribes used Mu in both everyday writing and formal
                documents. Its basic shape made it a reliable symbol for the /m/
                sound. Regional variations did occur, but the need for clarity
                in communication led to a more uniform shape over time. Mu was
                sometimes used in the Greek numeral system, where it represented
                a specific value, which helped traders and scholars in their
                calculations and record-keeping.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern Greek, Mu is a common letter found in textbooks,
                signs, and public writings. Its use is not limited to language;
                Mu also appears in many academic fields. In physics, for
                example, Mu is often seen as the symbol for the coefficient of
                friction or as a representation of the micro- prefix in units of
                measurement. In statistics, Mu can stand for the mean value of a
                population. These examples show that the letter has been adapted
                to meet practical needs in both language and science.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mu’s evolution from a simple mark in ancient writing to a
                versatile tool in modern notation reflects its enduring
                practicality. Its straightforward design influenced later
                writing systems, including the Latin alphabet. The use of Mu in
                technical and scientific contexts highlights its continued role
                as a clear and effective symbol for the /m/ sound.
