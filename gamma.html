                Gamma is the third letter of the Greek alphabet. It is named
                after the Phoenician letter gimel, which originally meant
                "camel." Why a camel? Nobody knows, but ancient writing was
                riddled with random animal forms, so it probably seemed like a
                good idea at the time. When the Greeks adopted it, they changed
                its form and gave it a harder sound, similar to the English "g."
            </p>
            <p>
                Gamma has all sorts of applications. In science, it refers to
                gamma rays, waves that are very high in energy and can pass
                through almost anything. It's also used in mathematics and
                physics to perform many calculations, as if the Greek alphabet
                wasn't already overused in those fields enough. In linguistics,
                gamma is used in pronunciation dictionaries, usually to confuse
                aspiring Greek language learners.

                Its shape has varied, but it has never had a plain, angular
                shape. The earliest shapes were an upside-down "L," but the
                modern Greek lowercase shape (γ) is a nice, rounded one. When
                the Romans borrowed the Greek alphabet, they weren't entirely
                sure what to do with gamma, so they constructed it from the
                letter C, which is why "C" sometimes gives a hard sound for
                "G.".
            </p>
            <p>
                While gamma is the third letter, somehow it is everywhere. It is
                in science, maths, statistics, and even ranking where one feels
                an urge to label things with Greek letters. It's not nearly as
                popular as alpha or beta, but people still use it anyway.
