                The letter Kappa is the tenth character in the Greek alphabet
                and represents the /k/ sound. It comes from the Phoenician
                letter Kaph, a symbol originally linked to the word meaning
                "palm." Early Greek writers adopted Kappa and gave it a simple
                form that matched the needs of their language. Greek scribes
                used the letter in everyday inscriptions and more formal texts,
                and its design varied slightly from one region to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, Kappa’s form became more uniform as writing practices
                evolved. In ancient Greece, many local variations existed, but
                the need for clear communication led to a standardized shape. As
                book manuscripts and later printed texts emerged, the letter was
                further refined to ensure legibility and ease of writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to its phonetic use, Kappa played a part in the
                Greek numeral system by representing a specific value in some
                contexts. This practical use helped scholars and traders deal
                with numbers directly in their texts. Today, the letter is not
                only a part of modern Greek writing but also appears in academic
                texts across various fields. In mathematics and science, Kappa
                is used as a variable or a constant in equations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kappa’s form influenced the development of similar characters in
                other alphabets, including the Latin K. Its clear and unadorned
                structure has made it a consistent tool in written communication
                for centuries. The letter maintains its practical role by
                providing a direct and reliable symbol for the /k/ sound in both
                historical and contemporary contexts.
