                Sigma is a letter that holds an important place in both the
                Greek alphabet and modern technical fields. Its roots can be
                traced back to ancient Phoenicia. Greek scribes adopted this
                letter from the Phoenician alphabet, where it appeared as
                “shin.” That original character carried the meaning of a tooth.
                Early Greeks adapted its shape as they built their own system of
                writing. The transformation from a pictograph to a letter marks
                a clear change from a visual symbol to a building block of
                language.

                The shape of sigma evolved over time. In early inscriptions, its
                form was more angular. As time went on, the Greeks introduced
                two variants for sigma. The letter appears in one form when it
                starts or is in the middle of a word and takes on a different
                shape at the end of a word. Nobody knows exactly why the two
                forms became necessary. Perhaps the change provided a visual cue
                that the letter was concluding a word.

                Today sigma is more than just a letter in a classical alphabet.
                In mathematics, the capital sigma represents summation and helps
                students and professionals add up series of numbers. The
                lower-case sigma is used in statistics to denote standard
                deviation. Scientists and engineers also use sigma in various
                formulas. The letter appears in academic texts and computer
                programming notation. Sigma has made its mark in cultural
                contexts as well, appearing in logos and emblems of modern
                organisations.
