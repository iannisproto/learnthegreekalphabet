                The Alpha letter, represented by the capital "Α" and lowercase
                "α," is the first alphabet letter in Greek. The letter was
                adapted from Phoenician "Aleph," which represented the ox and
                was used as the symbol for leadership and authority. The Greeks
                adopted the letter some time in the 8th century BCE and adjusted
                the shape and sound of the letter to accommodate their language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alpha in ancient Greece was greatly culturally esteemed. It was
                not just a letter; it signified beginnings. "Alpha and Omega,"
                or beginning and end, is often used in literature and religion
                to signify completeness. Alpha is often used in science and
                mathematics to signify the initial in a sequence or the highest
                order, as it was once a chieftain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alpha is important today, too. In Greek, it is the start, that
                is to say that it comes first. In other contexts, such as
                business and academia, "alpha" is used to denote a measurement
                of performance or distinction, again referencing its continuing
                importance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from its numeric and cultural importance, Alpha has also
                entered popular mass culture as a surname. It is used in an
                alternative group of names, organisations, and companies
                implying something superior or quality. University fraternity
                and sorority clubs typically use Greek letters for the titles of
                their clubs, one of which is Alpha, as an indication that the
                club is the first or the best.
