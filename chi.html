                The Greek letter chi, represented by Χ in uppercase and χ in
                lowercase, starts its story in the ancient Semitic world. Early
                Greek writers borrowed a symbol from Phoenician writing that may
                have carried a meaning like "support." Nobody knows exactly
                which Phoenician word sparked its use, but the cross-like design
                made it stand out. Greek scribes needed a letter for a sound
                that differed from kappa, so they adapted an X shape that proved
                both striking and practical.

            <p>
                In its early days, chi denoted an aspirated sound, one that
                began as a hard, breathy consonant. As time passed,
                pronunciations shifted. In classical settings, chi sounded much
                like a hard “k” with an extra puff of air. Over the centuries,
                the visual form of chi remained simple. Even as calligraphers
                and stone-carvers in ancient and medieval Greece added personal
                touches, the letter kept its clear-cut shape.

                Modern use of chi reaches far beyond the world of language.
                Mathematicians depend on it to represent the chi-squared
                statistic in tests that check how well observed data fit
                expected patterns. Scientists use chi to denote variables in
                equations across different fields, and programmers sometimes
                adopt it when naming functions or constants. Early Christians
                also embraced chi, merging it with another letter to create the
                Chi-Rho symbol, an early identifier for a central religious
                figure.
