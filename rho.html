                Rho has its origins in the ancient Phoenician alphabet. It comes
                from the Phoenician letter "resh", a term that meant “head.”
                Early on, a simple pictograph represented a head, and ancient
                traders adapted that symbol to stand for the /r/ sound. Greek
                scribes picked up the idea and gave us the familiar uppercase Ρ
                and lowercase ρ. Nobody knows why the Greeks made such slight
                modifications, but the Phoenician influence remains clear.

                In Greek, rho became a standard character used in inscriptions
                and texts. Its shape stayed largely the same as writing methods
                evolved, even as its use expanded from everyday language to
                scholarly work. Greek mathematicians and scientists started to
                use ρ in their writings. In physics, for example, ρ is now used
                as a symbol for density. In mathematics, you might see it
                denoting correlation coefficients or other variables.

                As the Latin alphabet emerged, many Greek letters were replaced
                for common language use, yet rho’s influence carried on in
                specialised fields. Even though modern writers favour the letter
                R for everyday use, ρ still appears in textbooks, research
                papers, and programming codes.
