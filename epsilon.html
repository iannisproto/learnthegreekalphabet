                The epsilon letter is from the Greek alphabet and originated
                from an extremely old writing system. It originated from the
                Phoenician alphabet where it was written as "he." The Phoenician
                term for "he" actually referred to "window." The Greeks adopted
                this letter and transformed it into epsilon, keeping the
                original sound but changing the shape slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Epsilon was given the fifth place in the Greek alphabet. As
                Greek writing developed, the form of epsilon was made more
                elegant. In earlier varieties, it was something a little
                different, but over time the form was made more beautiful to
                what most are accustomed to viewing today. Its main purpose was
                to symbolise the "e" sound. Even though it seems like it was
                simply a simple mark on paper, this letter played an important
                role in the way words were formed and spoken in ancient
                writings.

                In mathematics, it serves to represent a small value. You can
                find it in limit proofs and elsewhere where a small value will
                do. In science, epsilon can represent various constants and
                variables. Its purpose is basic and clear, much like the
                minimalist aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Linguists use epsilon to describe vowel sounds as well. It is
                used to mark the manner in which a sound remains constant
                irrespective of the context in which it occurs. Fascinating that
                a character drawn thousands of years ago continues to play a
                part in high school courses today. No one knows if the original
                creators hoped the letter would be so useful. However, epsilon
                remains a small but important part of writing systems both in
                the past and in technical writing.
