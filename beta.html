                Beta is the Greek letter B. It was derived from the Phoenician
                letter "Beth," which was "house." The symbols of ancient
                alphabets generally looked like things, so they gave this letter
                the shape of a rough sketch of a house. When the Greeks adopted
                it, they altered the way it was pronounced to signify the /b/
                sound. Its name, "beta," was merely a slight variation of its
                Phoenician origin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the second letter in the alphabet, beta is traditionally
                used to stand for the digit two or that something is in the
                second in order. Conversely, compared to alpha, with all the
                pride of being at the front end, beta will typically be
                associated with being a second best. This has led to some modern
                contexts where "beta" is used to tag as secondary or
                second-rate, as something not necessarily praising.
            </p>
            <p>
                The form of beta has changed through time. In early Greek
                inscriptions, it appeared more angular and different according
                to the style of writing. As the Greek alphabet grew more
                standardised, the form of beta settled into the form recognised
                today. When the Romans adopted the Greek alphabet into Latin,
                they modified beta somewhat and converted it into the letter B
                that is used today in numerous languages around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beta is also used extensively in science and mathematics. In
                physics, it denotes certain types of particles, while in finance
                it measures risk. It is also utilised in programming to refer to
                pre-final program versions before their completion.
