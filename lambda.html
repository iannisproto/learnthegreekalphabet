                The letter Lambda is the 11th character of the Greek alphabet.
                It comes from the Phoenician letter Lamed, a symbol linked to
                the concept of a goad or a tool used to guide livestock. Early
                Greek writers adopted Lambda with a simple form that suited the
                language’s needs. Greek scribes used it in everyday inscriptions
                and in formal writing, and the character’s shape was refined
                over time for clarity and ease of use.
            </p>
            <p>
                In early examples of Greek writing, Lambda was drawn as a simple
                angled line. Over time, regional variations existed, but the
                need for clear communication led to a more uniform shape. The
                letter was also used in the Greek numeral system to represent
                the number 30 in some contexts. This numerical role helped
                scholars and traders manage numbers directly in their texts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Lambda appears in modern Greek writing and in academic
                subjects such as mathematics and science. In physics, Lambda is
                often used to denote wavelength, while in computer science, it
                represents anonymous functions in various programming languages.
                These uses show that Lambda has maintained its practical role in
                written communication and technical notation.
